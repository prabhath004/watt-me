Load: 1.2 kW (moderate red line)
Sharing: 1.8 kW (green dashed line)
Receiving: 0.0 kW (flat blue line)
Battery: 85% (purple line stable)
```

**Energy Flow Diagram Shows:**

## 📊 **Understanding the Data**

### **Line Styles Mean:**

**Thick Lines (Primary Flows):**
- 🟡 Solar Production - Your main energy source
- 🔴 Home Consumption - Your main energy use

**Dashed Lines (Community Sharing):**
- 🟢 Sharing - When you help neighbors
- 🔵 Receiving - When neighbors help you

**Dotted Lines (Grid Interaction):**
- 🟠 Grid Import - Buying from utility
- 🟦 Grid Export - Selling to utility

**Purple Line (Battery):**
- 🟣 Battery SOC - Your energy storage level

---

### **Energy Balance Formula:**

```
Total Sources = Solar + Battery + Community + Grid
Total Uses = Load + Sharing + Grid Export

Balance = Sources - Uses
```

**Perfect Balance = 0.0 kW**
- Positive = You have excess energy
- Negative = You need more energy

## 🎯 **Demo Scenarios to Try**

### **1. Watch a Full Day Cycle**

**Morning (6-8 AM):**
- Solar rising, consumption high
- Battery charging begins
- May receive from community

**Midday (10 AM - 2 PM):**
- Solar at peak, consumption low
- Battery fully charged
- Sharing with community + grid export

**Evening (6-9 PM):**
- Solar declining, consumption spiking
- Battery discharging
- May need community help

**Night (10 PM - 5 AM):**
- No solar, low consumption
- Battery slowly discharging
- Minimal grid interaction
