- **Blue Line**: Grid Import (utility usage)
- Perfect for identifying trends and patterns
- Hover on lines to see exact values

**2. Area Chart Mode**
- Beautiful gradient-filled areas
- Stacked visualization showing energy proportions
- Color-coded with semi-transparent gradients
- Better for understanding total energy volumes
- Click the "Area" button to switch

#### ðŸ”¹ **Interactive Elements**

**Toggle Buttons (Top Right)**
- ðŸ“ˆ **Line Button**: Switch to line chart
- ðŸ“Š **Area Button**: Switch to area/gradient chart

**Hover Tooltips**
- Shows exact timestamp (date + time)
- All three values displayed with color dots
- Formatted as: `Production: 45.20 kWh`

**Legend**
- Click legend items to show/hide lines
- Useful for focusing on specific metrics

#### ðŸ”¹ **Summary Stats**

Below the chart, you'll see three color-coded totals:
- **Yellow Number**: Total Production across all hours
- **Green Number**: Total Microgrid Shared
- **Blue Number**: Total Grid Import

## ðŸŽ¨ Color Scheme

| Metric | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Production** | ðŸŸ¡ Warm Yellow | Solar energy generated |
| **Microgrid** | ðŸŸ¢ Green | Locally shared energy |
| **Grid Import** | ðŸ”µ Blue | External utility usage |

## ðŸ“ˆ What the Graph Shows

### **Daily Patterns You'll Notice:**

1. **Sunrise (6-8 AM)**
   - Production line starts rising
   - Grid import still high (morning usage)
   - Microgrid sharing begins

2. **Midday (10 AM - 2 PM)**
   - Production peaks (yellow line highest)
   - Grid import drops to minimum
   - Some microgrid activity from diverse orientations

3. **Evening (5-8 PM)**
   - Production drops sharply
   - Grid import spikes (peak demand)
   - Microgrid helps reduce grid dependency

4. **Night (10 PM - 5 AM)**
   - Zero production (flat yellow line)
   - Minimal grid import (low usage)
   - Batteries discharging

### **Multi-Day View**
- You'll see 5 repeating daily cycles
- Each day slightly different due to random variations
- Clear day/night rhythm

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use the Graph

### **Find Peak Solar Hours**
Look for the highest point on the yellow line (usually around noon)

### **Identify Grid Dependency**
Blue line shows when you're pulling from utility grid

### **See Community Sharing Success**
Green line shows when neighbors are helping neighbors

### **Compare Days**
Scrub across the X-axis to see how patterns repeat

### **Switch Views**
- Use **Line mode** for precise analysis
- Use **Area mode** for visual impact

---

## ðŸš€ Interactive Features

### **1. Switch Chart Types**
```
Top right corner buttons:
[Line] [Area]
```
Click to toggle between views instantly!

### **2. Hover for Details**
Move your mouse over any point on the chart to see:
- Exact timestamp
- Precise kWh values
- Color-coded metric labels

### **3. Read Summary Stats**
Below the chart, three large numbers show totals:
- Quick overview without analyzing the graph
- Color-matched to chart lines

## ðŸ”§ Customization Options

Want to modify the chart? Here are key settings in `CommunityTrendChart.tsx`:

```typescript
// Chart height
height={400}

// Line thickness
strokeWidth={2.5}

// Show/hide dots on lines
dot={false}

// Colors
Production: "hsl(45 93% 58%)"  // Yellow
Microgrid: "hsl(158 74% 40%)"  // Green
Grid Import: "hsl(218 100% 62%)" // Blue
```

## ðŸ“Š Example Insights You Can Derive

### **Community Performance**
- "We shared 4 kWh locally, avoiding grid import"
- "Peak production reached 80 kWh at noon"
- "Grid import reduced by 22% during day"

### **Solar Effectiveness**
- "East-facing panels peak at 10 AM"
- "West-facing panels peak at 2 PM"
- "South-facing panels peak at noon"

### **Optimization Opportunities**
- "High grid import at 6 PM â†’ add batteries"
- "Low microgrid sharing â†’ adjust timing"
- "Excess production at noon â†’ add storage"
